# dicer
A simple dice rolling game. With the Roll Dice option, you roll a new dice. However, if 1 comes, all your accumulated points will be deleted and the turn goes to the opponent. When you want to stop, you must select the hold option. If you do this, the points you have collected are saved and the turn of moves passes to the opponent. The side that reaches the 10-point score first wins the game.
